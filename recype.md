Ingredients
•	1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast
•	1 teaspoon sugar
•	1-1/4 cups warm water (110° to 115°)
•	1/4 cup canola oil
•	1 teaspoon salt
•	3-1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour
•	1/2 pound ground beef
•	1 small onion, chopped
•	1 can (15 ounces) tomato sauce
•	3 teaspoons dried oregano
•	1 teaspoon dried basil
•	1 medium green pepper, diced
•	2 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese




Directions
•	In large bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in water; let stand for 5 minutes. Add oil and salt. Stir in flour, 1 cup at a time, until a soft dough forms.
•	Turn onto floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 2-3 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, cook beef and onion over medium heat until no longer pink; drain.
•	Punch down dough; divide in half. Press each into a greased 12-in. pizza pan. Combine the tomato sauce, oregano and basil; spread over each crust. Top with beef mixture, green pepper and cheese.
•	Bake at 400° for 25-30 minutes or until crust is lightly browned.
